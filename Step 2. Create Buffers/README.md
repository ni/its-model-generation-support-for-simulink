# Create Buffers

The buses for Inverter Test System contains all the signals which can be read into your model and all the signals that your model can produce. 

1. Open MathWorks MATLABÂ®
2. Ensure that the "ITS_Create_Simulation_Interface_Buses.m" script path is on the Matlab path
3. Run "ITS_Create_Simulation_Interface_Buses.m"
4. Open your model

You can now use the Bus Selector to pick which signals you'd like to interact with. See the [example model](MirageMotorSettings_168_124.slx) for more details.
